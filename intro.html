            <p>The Battle Against the Empire's Arcade Weapon</p>   
                <br>
            <p>The Rebel Alliance faces a new threat from the Empire:</p>
            <p>A new weapon of the Empire, a retro arcade game that threatens to destroy all hope of defeating the dark side.</p>
            <p>A group of brave developers have come together to create a new game, one that will turn the tide of the battle. They are the only hope for the Rebel Alliance.</p>
            <p>As the team gathers in their secret hackathon location, they work tirelessly to create a game that will stand up against the Empire's evil weapon.</p>
            <p>Each keystroke, each line of code brings them closer to their goal.</p>
            <p>As they test their creation, the game comes to life. Blaster fire fills the room as the team battles their way through the levels.</p>
            <p>The fate of the galaxy rests on their shoulders.</p>
            <p>Only time will tell, as the game approaches completion and the team prepares to release it to the world.</p>   
            <p>May the code be with them.</p>
            <p>Long Live the Filthy Rebel Scum</p>
